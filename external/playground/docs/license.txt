In the event any proceeding or lawsuit is brought by PlayFirst or Licensee in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such proceeding or lawsuit shall be entitled to receive its costs, expert witness fees and reasonable attorney’s fees, including costs and fees on appeal. The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof, unless the waiver is in writing by Licensee or an authorized agent of PlayFirst, be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between PlayFirst and Licensee which supersedes any proposal or prior agreement, oral or written, and any other communications between the parties in relation to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be modified except by a subsequently dated written amendment or exhibit signed by both parties by their duly authorized representatives.

Additionally, if Licensee is a legal entity (e.g., corporation, partnership, etc.) the person consenting to this Agreement represents and warrants that he or she is an authorized agent of such entity and this Agreement legally obligates such entity to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
